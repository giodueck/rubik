# A Rubik's Cube solver as a console program for windows.
Version 2.0.1\
Changelog:
- Beginner algorithm added in the Basic class.
- Fixed a bug where sometimes the last step wouldn't complete.

# Several ways to play around
Pick wether an algorithm should solve the cube or you want to do it manually.

# Manual mode
To interact with the cube enter space separated sequences of moves in the standard notation (described here: https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/notation/).

# Algorithm mode
You have the possibility to see the move count breakdown of the chosen algorithm, and see how each step advanced the solution.
