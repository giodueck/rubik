# A Rubik's Cube solver as a console program for windows.
Version 0.3.2\
Changelog:
- CFOP class and simplified S_CFOP class declarations and files added. S_CFOP will be a simplified version of CFOP, which I have learned. CFOP will be true CFOP, with all the different algorithms.
- Moved CFOP files into src
- Basic class and files renamed to Beginner.

# Several ways to play around
Pick wether an algorithm should solve the cube or you want to do it manually.

# Manual mode
To interact with the cube enter space separated sequences of moves in the standard notation (described here: https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/notation/).

# Algorithm mode
You have the possibility to see the move count breakdown of the chosen algorithm, and see how each step advanced the solution.
