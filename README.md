# A Rubik's Cube solver as a console program for windows.
See an [updated version](https://github.com/giodueck/crubik) of the project here.

Version 0.3.3\
Changelog:
- Solver base class added. All solving algorithms will inherit from it.
- CFOP Cross step added, steps divided into functions.

# Several ways to play around
Pick wether an algorithm should solve the cube or you want to do it manually.

# Manual mode
To interact with the cube enter space separated sequences of moves in the standard notation (described here: https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/notation/).

# Algorithm mode
You have the possibility to see the move count breakdown of the chosen algorithm, and see how each step advanced the solution.
